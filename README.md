# On The Go Lutes (Capstone)

On the Go Lutes is a replication of the golutes website in a creative and user friendly design for mobile devices. Utilizing web scraping techniques, features such as team rosters, game statistics and game results are displayed in real time. Users will have greater accessibility to PLU sports while on the go through the direct link to the PLU streaming platform. The front end is built in Dart using the Flutter SDK, which makes the app compatible on both Android and iOS devices.

Worked in conjunction with Emily Sugimoto, a graduating B.A. Computer Science student.
